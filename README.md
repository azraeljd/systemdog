# System Dog
A system information fetcher.

It is similar to [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch),
but more lightweight and simpler.

System Dog is not made to look beautiful for screenshots, rather
it is only for displaying your system information, though there will be themes and extensions in a
later version if you really want to beautify it.
